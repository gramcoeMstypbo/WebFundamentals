## Lantek Expert 26 Features
  
Lantek Expert 26 has many features that make it a powerful and versatile CAD/CAM nesting software system for sheet metal cutting. Some of these features are:

- Drag & Drop importer: You can easily import parts from different file formats (DXF, DWG, IGES, etc.) by dragging and dropping them into the Lantek Expert interface. You can also import parts from Lantek's parametric parts library or from other Lantek solutions.
- Draft part management: You can create draft parts that are not ready for production and store them in a separate folder. You can edit, delete, or move draft parts to the production folder when they are finalized.
- Expand parts in nesting: You can expand parts that have internal contours or holes in the nesting process to improve the cutting quality and reduce the risk of collisions.
- Clean Cut property: You can avoid applying technology (lead-ins, micro-joints, etc.) to small geometries that do not need them. This can save time and material and improve the appearance of the parts.
- Teamwork: You can use the floating license option to allow multiple users to access the system. You can also share data and information with other Lantek solutions or external systems through Lantek's PowerSync technology.
- Advanced milling technology management: You can use Lantek Expert 26 to program milling operations on planar profiles for steelwork applications. You can choose from different machining strategies and tooling options to achieve the best results.
- Process automation module: You can automate daily tasks and workflows with Lantek Expert 26. You can also use the Flex3d engine as a blackbox that can perform different tasks without human intervention.

Lantek Expert 26 is constantly evolving to meet the needs and expectations of sheet metal cutting customers. It is a reliable and innovative solution that can help you achieve your goals and grow your business.
